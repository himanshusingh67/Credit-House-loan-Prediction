# Credit Risk analysis using Machine learning

Building a model to estimate how capable each applicant is of repaying a loan, with the goal of only approving loans for those who are most likely to repay them. We want to be very certain when we categorize someone as a non-defaulter as the cost of making a mistake might be quite costly to organizations. 


## Tech Used
Python-(numpy,pandas,sklearn,statsmodels,imblearn)
## Overview
This is a simple applicant classification problem trained on four different models.The shape of dataset used is (307511,122) with a class imbalance dealt using SMOTE.The missing values has been filled after getting deeper insights of the data. Data has been transfomed,scaled and new features has been added according to the relationships between existing features.Multicollinearity has been removed using VIF and further features have been selected using RFE for each model. The project includes making multiple models and comparison has been done on the predictions of these models. Among all the models XGBoost performs the best.
## Motivation
A number of times bank and financial organisations has to deal with a lot of loss because of approving loans of the applicants which can't repay the loan. Business can be increased by getting to know before hand about an applicants ability to repay a loan, based on the information of the applicant. Focussing on correctly predicting as many defaulters as possible and having high recall and F1-score.
